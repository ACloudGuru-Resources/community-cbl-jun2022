# Cloud Builder Live - June 2022

![Cloud Builder Live Thumbnail](/images/thumbnail.jpg)

In this session, David will review how to deploy an HTTP microservice from a GitHub repository using Cloud Run with continuous delivery.  This session will be for developers who are new to Cloud Run or even developers who are completely new to GCP.

## Prerequisites

I'm trying to have as few prerequisites as possible for this one.  That being said, the following would be helpful:

- VS Code ([install](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- ThunderClient for VS Code ([install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client))
- Docker ([install](https://www.docker.com/))
- GCP Account (if you don't have one, I'll tell you how to set one up)

## Branches and Code

This repository has a container for sharing COVID data via an API.  You can read more about the data below.  This is not designed to be a production application, but it is instead a microservice for use in cloud demos.  

| Branch | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **main** | This is the initial state of the application at the beginning of the episode. |
| **finish** | This is the end state of the application from the episode |
